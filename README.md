# FAMOUS ‚ö°üîç

FAMOUS is a WEB platform that allows users to find social media accounts.

It's easy to use, just enter the username of the person you want to find and FAMOUS will do the rest.
And it's blazing fast ‚ö°

This project is largely based on the [Sherlock Project](https://github.com/sherlock-project).
The main difference is that FAMOUS is a web platform, while Sherlock is a python CLI tool.
